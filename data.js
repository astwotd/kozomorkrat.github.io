      <p>
        They say that deep in the darkest, wildest forests lives Kozomor - a creature neither man nor beast, but the keeper of secrets hidden from ordinary travelers.
        Its face is not carved nor made - it grows from bark, rags, and the dust of centuries, as if the forest itself decided to gaze upon the world through it. Anyone who glimpses the mask of Kozomor understands: this is not merely a face, but a gatekeeper between worlds.
        Legend tells that if you wear the mask, you’ll hear whispers of ancient spirits and feel the forest breathing with your breath. But not all can bear this gift - many who stray from the path remain forever in the woods, becoming part of its eternal story.
        That’s why the mask is kept safe and not worn lightly. It calls only those ready to become guardians of shadows and voices long forgotten.

      <p>
        There once was a thicket - not too deep, not too wide, but strange. By day, it looked like any other: pines, mosquitoes, stumps, and mushrooms. But at night… who knows?
        The old folks said that if you walked that path after sundown, you’d hear someone calling a name - only it wouldn’t be yours. People got spooked, lost their shoes, came back without their shadows. One old man returned with someone else’s voice.
        So they hung up the Watcher. No one claimed to have made it. One morning, it was just there - knotted, twisted, silent. It looked sideways, as if listening to something you couldn’t hear.
        Since then, no one disappeared. Well, except one dog who howled for three days, then walked into the woods alone. Come spring, there was a new scrap of cloth on the Watcher… as if it had reinforced itself.
        So if you pass by - don’t look into its eyes.
        It has none. But it sees you anyway.

        This small talisman is said to be the very Palm of the Guardian — a village girl from the fields. Though simple and humble, she carried a soul capable of protecting the harvest and shielding the home from misfortune.
        People kept her close, to feel the touch of the earth and the strength of their ancestors. If such a talisman is lost, it’s believed the Guardian departs, leaving the home unprotected.
        Whoever finds this Palm in the forest will gain not only protection but also a reminder that even a small hand can hold the weight of a great world.

        My friend’s great-grandmother Lazhinka (in the middle) was an aristocrat who liked to wear white gloves and smoke long cigarettes in them.  
        She is pictured here with my great-grandfather Alishandr (on the right), standing alongside their neighbours dressed in traditional Ossetian clothing.  
        My favourite piece from their costume is the <em>kamari</em> women’s belt (a Georgian word that came from Iran).  
        Circa 1920’s.

      <p>
        They say there was once a forest where the trees didn’t whisper - they listened. Whenever a person stepped inside, each footfall echoed through the roots. Those who carried lies in their hearts never found the way out.
        At the center of that forest stood a totem - woven from roots, cloth, and shadow. It wasn’t carved or placed - it grew on its own, right where a man once spoke a truth his entire bloodline had denied.
        The totem doesn’t watch with eyes but with a knot of time. It doesn’t judge, but it remembers - who passed, and with what.
        And if one night you feel something watching - don’t look. That’s him.<br>
        And if you aren’t lying to yourself - he’ll let you through.

        They say there once lived a woman who knew the language of those who no longer speak. Not people, not animals - but shadows left behind by actions.
        She didn’t write, didn’t talk - she tied knots, and each knot was a promise. When she died, no one wept. But a few days later, a totem appeared deep in the woods - twisted and tense, like a tightened oath.
        Some say it moves at night, as if breathing someone else’s fate. Others hear it creak when someone nearby speaks a lie. This totem doesn’t ask, doesn’t guard, and doesn’t judge. It simply remembers what you once promised yourself - and never kept.

      <p>
        In the second half of the 20s - early 30s years of the XX century the Soviet Union's indigenization policy. 
        Therefore, most of the districts of Eastern Slobozhanshchyna received the status of national, and a certain Ukrainization was carried out in the cultural sphere. 
        However, this was phased out in the 1930s. Active Russification of these lands began. Over time, many Ukrainians in the Eastern Slobozhanshchyna "became Russians". 
        Therefore, the percentage of the Ukrainian population in this region during the censuses was constantly decreasing. The nationality (ethnic Ukrainian) 
        of my grandmother Matrona (second from right) was replaced in the passport with Russian. Although, nevertheless, people who identify themselves as Ukrainians remain here.
        So, according to the 1989 census, 74.6 percent of Ukrainians lived in the Rivne district of the Belgorod region. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
        there were certain attempts to revive Ukrainian life in the Eastern Sloboda region. Since 2001, festivals of Ukrainian culture have been held in the city of Rossosh 
        (the regional center of the Voronezh region) for a decade. However, in the current conditions, the Russian leadership does not welcome the manifestations of
        Ukrainianism in their state. About Ukrainian institutions, constant harassment is carried out here. Therefore, it is obvious that the manifestations of Ukrainian 
        life in the Eastern Sloboda region, as well as in other Ukrainian regions of the Russian Federation, are "muffled".

        They say this board was found in the ashes where a house once stood - burned to the ground, yet the board remained, untouched, as if it had been waiting.
        There were no pieces on it. Only traces - worn spots, faint marks, like someone had played their whole life and then vanished.
        Old folks whisper: this is no chessboard, but a place where destinies were moved. Each square - a choice. Each corner - a turning point.
        Those who touch it begin to remember moves they never made.
        But remember - the pieces always come later. First comes the board.<br>
        And if you’ve found it - the game hasn’t begun yet.<br>
        But it will.

        <p>
Back when beasts still remembered the names of their ancestors, and humans had not yet forgotten how to speak with shadows, there lived a creature - not quite a wolf, not quite a bear, not quite a dog from the world of dreams. It did not hunt for flesh, but for scents, tracks, bites, and fear. It knew every trail, every death, and every lie.
One day, it came to a man who had broken the ancient pact: he killed without gratitude and fed without understanding what he consumed. So the beast tore off its own nose - to smell no more guilt, broke out its fangs - to tear no more flesh, and ripped off its claws - to grasp no longer. It bound them together with twine soaked in the blood of memory. It turned black to vanish from this world.
This bundle - the Knot of the Beast’s Memory - was later found by shamans. They hung it at a crossroads of branches, so that anyone who passed would remember:
If you do not honor what you eat, one day you will become the knot.
They say if you touch the knot at full moon, you may see the beast’s final dream. But not everyone wakes up after that.

        Formed from silence and stored heat, these soot-black fists contain eyes like empty coals.
            Found in forgotten blankets, at the base of old stoves, or under beds where grief once slept.
         Not spirits, not symbols — but remnants.

        It doesn’t reflect your face. It shows a memory of you. Sometimes - your own. More often - someone else's. Some say they see who they could have been, but never became.
        Others say that if you stare into it too long, it begins to sigh. But it's not the mirror - it's you forgetting how to breathe.
